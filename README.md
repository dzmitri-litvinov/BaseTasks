# BaseTasks
This public repository contains console applications created during studying in DevIncubator.
## [1st part]
* [Binary To Decimal](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/from2To10.cpp) - convert the number from binary to decimal.
* [Least Common Multiple](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/LeastCommonMultiple.cpp) - find the least common multiple of two natural numbers.
* [Triangle Type](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/TriangleType.cpp) - define triangle type after entering all 3 sides.
## [2nd part]
* [The first number after point](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/firstNumberAfterPoint.cpp) - show the first number after point in double number.
* [Guess the number](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/GuessTheNumber.cpp) - Guess the number between 1 and 10. Computer will say, is the number less or more than entered.
## [3rd part]
* [Fibonacci number](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/03fibonacciNumbers.cpp) - show you the Fibonacci number in desired position.
* [Binary numbers contain 1 only](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/03numbersWithOnly1InBinary.cpp) - show you all decimal numbers from 0 to desired which consist of only 1 if converted to binary numbers.
* [Power](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/03power.cpp) - raise the number x to the power n.
## [4th part]
* [Fate number](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/04fateNumber.cpp) - calculate number of fate. The digits of the full date of birth are added together until one digit is obtained.
* [Turn over](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/04turnOver.cpp) - a fuction which turns int number, e.g. 1234 -> 4321
## [5th part]
* [Observation system](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/05observationSystem.cpp) - The array stores the values of the terrain profile heights with a constant horizontal step. The app finds areas (elevation points) that are invisible to the observer at the first point.
* [Recruits](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/05recruits.cpp) - army simulator. Further, each recruit acts as follows: he sees the face of a neighbor in front of him, he turns around in exactly a second. Eventually the turns will stop and the sergeant will beep.
## [6th part]
* [Cube Transparency](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/06cubeTransparency.cpp) - find out whether the cube has any transparency.
* [Tic-Tac](https://github.com/dzmitri-litvinov/BaseTasks/blob/main/06ticTac.cpp) - Tic-Tac game against computer.
